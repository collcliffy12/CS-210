# CS-210-Course
#Airgead_Banking Project

#Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The main problem this project is solving is the need to provide high school students with an interactive and engaging way to learn about financial concepts such as investing and compound interest, which are essential for developing fiscal responsibility. The project involves creating an object-oriented programming (OOP) application using C++ code, with a focus on writing clean, efficient, and secure code that includes in-line comments.

#What did you do particularly well?
My implementation of the Airgead Banking application demonstrates a strong understanding of industry-standard best practices. The use of classes to encapsulate the investment data and calculations is something I did well, as this approach promotes code reusability and maintainability. Additionally, the well-structured and modular nature of my code makes it easy for others to follow and extend the application in the future.

#Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
To enhance my work, I believe that adding more detailed comments, particularly in sections involving complex calculations, would enhance the code's documentation and make it easier for others to understand and work with. Breaking down some of the larger functions into smaller, more manageable components could also help push the code to an exemplary level.

#Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The most challenging aspects of writing code for this project was structuring the code in a modular and maintainable way. Designing the class structure and ensuring proper encapsulation of data and functionality are crucial for the long-term sustainability of the application. To address this, I researched object-oriented design patterns and principles, seeking to apply them effectively in my code.

#What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Some of the key skills that will be particularly useful going forward are OOP Principles and Code Organization/Modularization. My experience in designing and implementing the application using classes and encapsulation will be valuable when working on other object-oriented projects, regardless of the programming language. Understanding concepts like data abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism will help me approach problem-solving in a more structured and maintainable way. Additionally, understanding the importance of separation of concerns and following best practices for code organization will serve me well in my future endeavors.

#How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I organized the code into well-defined classes and functions, each responsible for a specific aspect of the application's functionality. This modular design promotes code reusability, makes the code easier to understand and maintain, and allows for easier adaptability in the future.
